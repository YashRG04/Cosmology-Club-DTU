                      From August 29 to September 23, 2024, the Cosmology Club of DTU participated in the International
                      Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC) CB Devgun Campaign, a global initiative focused on
                      discovering and monitoring asteroids and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). Named after CB Devgun,
                      this campaign engaged participants in planetary science while enhancing their astronomical
                      knowledge.

                      The club formed several teams of 4-5 members, each analyzing unique image sets provided by the
                      Institute for Astronomy (IfA) at the University of Hawaii. Using Astrometrica software, the teams
                      tracked moving objects and created reports for the Minor Planet Centre (MPC), which IASC reviewed
                      for potential detections.

                      The campaign proved educational and rewarding, emphasizing the importance of global collaboration
                      in scientific research and providing members with valuable hands-on experience in asteroid
                      detection and data analysis.

                      Manish Purohit is a specialist in quantum communication and has contributed to projects at ISRO
                      (Indian Space Research Organisation). In his online session, he discussed the basics of quantum
                      communication, its importance, and ISRO's advancements in this field. He explained how this
                      technology uses quantum mechanics to ensure secure data transmission, highlighting ISRO's
                      efforts
                      in overcoming technical challenges.
                      The session was informative, offering insights into how quantum communication can transform
                      secure
                      data transfer and enhance national security. Manish’s clear explanation of complex topics made
                      it
                      easier for attendees to understand the future potential of this technology.

                      On November 8, 2023, the IAPS (International Association of Physics Students) organized the IAPS
                      School Day, drawing over 50 enthusiastic students from St. Frobel School, with support from 10
                      IAPS volunteers and 25 from DTU. The event began with an introductory session, setting the stage
                      for a day filled with engaging activities, including quizzes, hands-on experiments, and a lab
                      tour.

                      Students explored fascinating topics, such as the mysteries of spacetime and the parallax effect
                      in astronomy, gaining practical insights into scientific concepts. The event was a resounding
                      success, sparking a love for science and inspiring young minds. Through interactive learning,
                      IAPS
                      continues to promote science education and nurture the next generation of scientists and
                      innovators.

                      On August 23, 2023, at 5:00 PM, the Cosmology Club of DTU organized a live screening of
                      Chandrayaan-3's historic lunar landing at SPS8. The event attracted astronomy enthusiasts,
                      students, and scientific community members eager to witness this monumental moment. As ISRO's
                      mission control displayed the spacecraft's precise descent and successful touchdown on the Moon,
                      the room was filled with excitement and pride, showcasing India's growing expertise in space
                      exploration.

                      The meticulous engineering and planning behind Chandrayaan-3 were evident as the mission
                      achieved
                      a smooth and precise landing on the lunar surface. The event concluded in a celebratory
                      atmosphere, with participants reflecting on this remarkable achievement. Many expressed pride in
                      India's progress in space technology and hope for the future of space exploration, inspired by
                      ISRO's accomplishment.

                      do various activities for fun. And it also aims to
                      provide an open window for interaction with others in
                      the field to do the exchange of thoughts with each
                      other. Presently in this event, we broadcast episodes of
                      the famed show "Cosmos - A Space Time Odyssey", which
                      were followed by doubt clearing sessions and a quiz
                      related to the episode theme. Sometimes we also
                      broadcast events of importance in the Astro field that
                      are recognized to be a history-making event and are also
                      famous around the globe(like. the first flight of
                      Ingenuity and the touchdown of the Perseverance rover).
                      We are planning to add more activities to this event

                      All Abode was a hackathon organized by Cosmology Club.
                      The topic of the hackathon was Mars Exploration and
                      Colonization. In this project team of 3 was formed
                      comprising of students from DTU and outside DTU. The
                      problem statement given to all the teams was that : "
                      The year is 2030 and there is an impending doom on the
                      very existence of human life. The Scientist and
                      astronomers at ISRO have detected an asteroid that is on
                      its way to strike Earth. The impact will be apocalyptic,
                      even larger than the 'Chicxupub impactor ' one that
                      wiped out all the dinosaurs and humans have now no
                      choice except to ' Relocate! '. After many days of
                      discussions by space agencies, they have created a team
                      of a few astronomers and scientists to come up to devise
                      a plan to start a colony. " The duration of the
                      Hackathon was 6 days in which teams were challenged to
                      create a foolproof plan for colonization on Mars,
                      including construction, food supply, maintenance,
                      disaster management, and all other necessities of life.
                      The winners were awarded a certificate and discovery
                      plus subscription of 1 year whereas runners-up were also
                      awarded a discovery plus subscription of 1 month

                      cm × 10 cm × 10 cm size. CubeSats have a mass of no more
                      than 1.33 kilograms per unit, and often use commercial
                      off-the-shelf (COTS) components for their electronics
                      and structure. CubeSats are commonly put in orbit by
                      deployers on the International Space Station or launched
                      as secondary payloads on a launch vehicle. As of 1

                      launched. More than 1200 have been successfully deployed
                      in orbit and more than 90 have been destroyed in launch
                      failures The CubeSat specification accomplishes several
